o searches for and uses "file" objects as well as data frame objects.
  file.format argument or "file.format" attribute on file object
  is a list with arguments accepted by sqliteImportFile.
  [Thanks to Soren Hojsgaard for suggestion to support files.]

o dots in argument list replaced with a single variable x.
  x can be a "character" vector in which case each component is 
  executed by SQLite in turn and result of the last is returned.

o new dbname argument can be specified.  For SQLite it defaults to ":memory:",

  are are deleted on exit.
