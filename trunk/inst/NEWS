  is a list with arguments accepted by sqliteImportFile.
  [Thanks to Soren Hojsgaard for suggestion to support files.]

o dots in argument list replaced with a single variable x.
  x can be a "character" vector in which case each component is 
  executed by SQLite in turn and result of the last is returned.

o new dbname argument can be specified.  For SQLite it defaults to ":memory:",
  i.e. an embedded data base.  If database does not exist it is created
  and deleted upon exit.  If it does exist then only tables created by sqldf
  are deleted on exit but not the database itself.
