Version 0.2-1

o bug fixes

o certain Date conversions which previously required as.Date.numeric from zoo
  package no longer depend on zoo

Version 0.2-0

o column names which are SQL reserved words are no longer mangled

o file.format list can contain a filter which is a batch or shell command
  that filters the input file

o read.csv2.sql is like read.csv.sql but has a default filter which translates 
  each comma in the input file to a dot

o if getOption("sqldf.dll") defaulting to libspatial-1.dll is found on the PATH
  then it will be loaded as an SQLite loadable extension.  With the default this
  gives access to these SQL functions:
  http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/spatialite-sql-2.3.1.html
  The sqldf package does not itself include this or any other SQLite loadable
  extension.  The user must download and place it on the PATH if they wish to 
  use it.  libspatialite-1.dll can be found here:
  http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite
  If sqldf does not find the dll on the PATH then sqldf will continue to work 
  but without access to these functions.

Version 0.1-7

o now supports table names with a dot in them provided that they are 
  placed within backquotes

o bug fixes (thanks to Soren Hojsgaard for bug report)

Version 0.1-3

o corrected DESCRIPTION file

Version 0.1-2

o searches for and uses "file" objects as well as data frame objects.
  file.format argument or "file.format" attribute on file object
  is a list with arguments accepted by sqliteImportFile.
  [Thanks to Soren Hojsgaard for suggestion to support files.]

o dots in argument list replaced with a single variable x.
  x can be a "character" vector in which case each component is 
  executed by SQLite in turn and result of the last is returned.

o new dbname argument can be specified.  For SQLite it defaults to ":memory:",
  i.e. an embedded data base.  If database does not exist it is created
  and deleted upon exit.  If it does exist then only tables created by sqldf
  are deleted on exit but not the database itself.

o improvements in sqldf.Rd

o MySQL testing

o added a demo illustrating sorting and grouping vs. nested selects

o new example illustrating vector x

o support for POSIXct, Date and chron dates and times
