Description:  Package sqldf contains a single function, also called
	sqldf, that is typically passed a single argument which is
	an SQL select statement where the table names are ordinary
	R data frames.  sqldf transparently sets up a database, imports
	the data frames into that database, performs the SQL select 
	statement and returns the result using a heuristic to determine 
	what class to assign to each column of the returned data frame.
Depends: R (>= 2.5.1), RSQLite (>= 0.5-5), gsubfn
